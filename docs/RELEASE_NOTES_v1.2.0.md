**Type:** Minor Release - Home Assistant Overhaul  
**Target Platform:** Raspberry Pi 5 with NVME SSD  

## 🎉 Major Improvements

### **Complete Home Assistant Setup Overhaul**
- **Replaced** custom experimental approach with proven, documented method
- **Following** Neil Turner's tested guide exactly
- **Implemented** official Home Assistant Supervised installer requirements
- **Eliminated** dependency guesswork and package conflicts

### **Root Cause Resolution**
- **Problem**: Over-engineering simple Home Assistant installation
- **Solution**: Follow the proven guide that actually works
- **Result**: Reliable, tested installation process

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **Dependencies Fixed (Official List)**
```bash
# OFFICIAL REQUIREMENTS (from HA Supervised installer)
jq wget curl avahi-daemon udisks2 libglib2.0-bin
apparmor apparmor-utils ca-certificates cifs-utils
dbus network-manager systemd-journal-remote systemd-resolved
```

### **Installation Process Simplified**
```bash
# PROVEN 4-STEP PROCESS:
1. Install dependencies (official list)
2. Install Docker (curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh)
3. Install OS Agent (.deb package)
4. Install Home Assistant Supervised (.deb package)
```

### **Following Proven Guide**
- **Reference**: [Neil Turner's Home Assistant Supervised Guide](https://neilturner.me.uk/2024/01/10/how-to-install-home-assistant-supervised-on-a-raspberry-pi/)
- **Approach**: Exact implementation of documented, working method
- **No more**: Custom package lists or experimental configurations

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### **Fixed Dependency Errors**
- ✅ No more "apparmor command not found"
